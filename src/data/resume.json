I have overseen marketing campaigns for the company and its products, during which time I led design and development on the corporate website, along with digital and print collateral. I regularly author and edit state and federal contract proposals.\n\n I began my work at BullsEye as an intern, maintaining EZ RF™, gaining expertise with Visual Basic and familiarity with Oracle. I later personally oversaw the implementation of a subversion source code control system, further supplemented with a test case management suite, all through the use of open source software. I was given the role of lead software developer for a federal government project, involving a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) program in Microsoft Excel with comprehensive data analysis and reporting capabilities.\n\nI returned to BullsEye to serve as a software developer and technical writer for varied state and federal government projects. These projects have been based in product research, solution design, software development, system validation, and proposal writing. I currently serve as the Director of Engineering.",

The dynamic impact testing and calibration instrument (DITCI) is a simple instrument with a significant data collection and analysis capability that is used for the testing and calibration of biosimulant human tissue artifacts. These artifacts may be used to measure the severity of injuries caused in the case of a robot impact with a human."
